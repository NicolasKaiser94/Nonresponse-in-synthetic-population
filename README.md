# Nonresponse-in-synthetic-population
 Missing data occur in almost every data set and can distort corresponding statements about the underlying population.  
 This work aims to achieve three objectives: 1. to provide a brief introduction to the problem of missing data. 
 2. to explain how missing data can be simulated and what criteria can should be used to evaluate the performance of different correction methods. 
 3. to demonstrate, by means of a simulation study, how to proceed with such a study and how the results can be interpreted.
 
 The project was a term paper written at the University of Trier. You can find all relevant in information within. The R code gives the programming background.
